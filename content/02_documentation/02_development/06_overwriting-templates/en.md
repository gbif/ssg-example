# Overwriting templates

At times you might fond that the existing templates are not what you want. All templates are copied to a temporary folder before being applied. That way you can overwrite them.
Template files located in `./src/templates/` will overwrite the default ones. To do so they must of course be named the same. You can see the default templates at https://github.com/gbif/ssg/tree/master/src/templates
